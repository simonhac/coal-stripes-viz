# Summary of "fix tooltips" Commit Changes

## Overview
The "fix tooltips" commit made changes to 4 files to implement a tooltip synchronization system where hovering over a day would show the corresponding month in all regions.

## Files Changed

### 1. src/app/page.tsx
- Added new state variables:
  - `showRegionAverages`: boolean state for showing region averages
  - `hoveredMonth`: state for tracking which month is hovered
  - `hoveredDay`: state for tracking which day is hovered
- Modified RegionSection props to pass these new states and handlers

### 2. src/components/CapFacXAxis.tsx
- Added props for hover synchronization:
  - `hoveredMonth`
  - `onMonthHover` 
  - `onMonthHoverEnd`
- Added useEffect to show tooltips when a month is hovered (from any region)
- Added mouse event handlers for month labels

### 3. src/components/CompositeTile.tsx
- Added props:
  - `hoveredDay`
  - `onDayHover`
  - `onDayHoverEnd`
- Added logic to trigger day hover events when mousing over the canvas

### 4. src/components/RegionSection.tsx
- Added many new props for hover coordination:
  - `showRegionAverage`
  - `onRegionHover`/`onRegionHoverEnd`
  - `hoveredMonth`
  - `onMonthHover`/`onMonthHoverEnd`
  - `hoveredDay`
  - `onDayHover`/`onDayHoverEnd`
- Added logic to show region averages on hover
- Passed new props down to child components

## The Bug
This implementation had the issue where hovering over a day would show month tooltips in other regions (derived from the hovered day), which would immediately override the day tooltip in the hovered region.
