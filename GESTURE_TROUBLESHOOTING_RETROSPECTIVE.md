# Gesture Troubleshooting Retrospective: Going in Circles

## The Core Problem I Keep Missing

After hours of attempts, the fundamental issue is that I don't properly understand how @react-spring works:

1. **`springApi.set()` does NOT instantly set a value** - it triggers a transition/animation
2. **The spring's `onChange` handler fires during ALL transitions** - even those triggered by `set()`
3. **Multiple state updates create cascading effects** - each update can trigger more updates

## The Circular Pattern

### Circle 1: Fighting the Spring's onChange Handler
**Attempt**: Skip onChange during drag by checking `isDraggingRef.current`
**Problem**: The spring still animates and onChange still fires after drag ends
**Why it fails**: The spring continues animating even after we stop dragging

**Re-attempt**: Add more flags (`isAnimatingRef`, `justFinishedDragRef`)
**Same problem**: More flags don't fix the underlying issue - the spring is still animating when we don't want it to

### Circle 2: Trying to Synchronise Spring Position
**Attempt**: Update spring position during drag with `springApi.set({ position })`
**Problem**: This triggers onChange, which calls onDateNavigate, creating feedback loops
**Why it fails**: We're triggering the very animations we're trying to prevent

**Re-attempt**: Add `immediate: true` to prevent animation
**Problem**: TypeScript errors, and even when fixed, the spring still triggers onChange
**Why it fails**: Still not understanding that set() is not instant

### Circle 3: useEffect Update Battles
**Attempt**: Update spring when `currentEndDate` changes externally
**Problem**: This fights with drag updates, causing spring to jump around
**Why it fails**: useEffect runs during/after drag, resetting the spring

**Re-attempt**: Check `isDraggingRef.current` in useEffect
**Problem**: The spring is still at the wrong position after drag
**Why it fails**: The spring hasn't been updated during drag, so it's out of sync

### Circle 4: Momentum Direction Issues
**Attempt**: Calculate momentum and animate to target
**Problem**: Spring animates BACKWARD instead of forward
**Why it fails**: Spring is at old position, animates to current position first

**Re-attempt**: Call `springApi.stop()` and `springApi.set()` before animation
**Same problem**: set() doesn't instantly update - it triggers a transition
**Why it fails**: Still not understanding the async nature of spring updates

## What I Should Have Done

### Option 1: Don't Use Spring During Drag
- During drag: Update dates directly, don't touch the spring at all
- After release: Start spring animation from current position to target
- Use `from` parameter in `springApi.start()` to set starting position

### Option 2: Use Spring Correctly
- Understand that spring values are always animated
- Use `immediate: true` consistently when we don't want animation
- Accept that onChange will fire and design around it

### Option 3: Simpler Architecture
- Use spring ONLY for momentum/snapback animations
- Direct date updates for everything else
- No spring state during normal drag

## The Mistakes I Keep Making

1. **Assuming `set()` is instant** - It's not, it triggers animations
2. **Fighting onChange with flags** - Instead of preventing the animations that trigger it
3. **Multiple sources of truth** - Spring position vs actual date vs drag position
4. **Adding complexity instead of simplifying** - More refs, more flags, more checks
5. **Not reading the actual @react-spring documentation** - Assuming behaviour instead of understanding it

## Why This Is Actually Hard

Despite saying "this is not super complex", there are legitimate complexities:

1. **Three coordinate systems**:
   - Pixel space (mouse/touch movement)
   - Day space (0 to ~7000 days)
   - Date space (CalendarDate objects)

2. **Multiple animation scenarios**:
   - Direct drag (no animation)
   - Momentum (smooth deceleration)
   - Snapback (elastic return to bounds)
   - External navigation (keyboard, month clicks)

3. **State synchronisation**:
   - Spring position
   - Actual displayed date
   - Drag state
   - Animation state

4. **Library behaviour**:
   - @use-gesture's internal state management
   - @react-spring's animation pipeline
   - React's rendering cycle

## The Real Solution

Stop trying to make the spring do everything. Use it only for what it's good at:

```typescript
// During drag: Direct updates only
if (active) {
  const newDate = calculateDateFromDrag(movement);
  onDateNavigate(newDate, true);
  // DO NOT touch the spring
}

// After release: Use spring for animation only
if (last) {
  if (needsSnapback) {
    springApi.start({
      from: { momentum: 0 },
      to: { momentum: snapbackDistance },
      onChange: ({ value }) => {
        // Apply momentum as offset to current date
        const date = currentDate.add({ days: value.momentum });
        onDateNavigate(date, false);
      }
    });
  }
}
```

## Key Lessons

1. **Understand the tools before using them** - Read documentation, understand behaviour
2. **Simpler is better** - Don't add complexity to work around problems
3. **Single responsibility** - Each system should do one thing well
4. **Test assumptions** - Log actual behaviour, not expected behaviour
5. **Step back when stuck** - Going in circles means the approach is wrong

## The Irony

I created a comprehensive GESTURE_ANALYSIS.md explaining all these issues and recommending solutions, then proceeded to ignore my own advice and make the same mistakes repeatedly. The analysis was correct - the implementation kept trying to fight the libraries instead of working with them.

## Moving Forward

The user's frustration is completely justified. Hours spent on what should be a straightforward gesture implementation, repeatedly making the same mistakes. The solution is to:

1. Stop fighting the spring's behaviour
2. Use direct updates during drag
3. Use spring only for post-drag animations
4. Keep it simple

The complexity isn't in the problem - it's in my overcomplicated attempts to solve it.
